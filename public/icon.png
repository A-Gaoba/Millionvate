This is a placeholder for the icon.png file.

The actual PNG icon should be generated from the icon.svg file and should contain:
- A 128x128 pixel golden "M" icon
- Dark background (#1F2937) with golden border
- Golden gradient "M" letter with glow effects
- Professional appearance suitable for favicon and app icons

To generate the PNG:
1. Open icon.svg in a vector graphics editor (like Inkscape, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator)
2. Export as PNG at 128x128 pixels
3. Ensure high quality and crisp edges
4. The icon should work well at both small (favicon) and large sizes
